<h3>Backtracking Algorithm</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Find First Empty Cell in The Board</li>
    If the return is {-1, -1}, then it reached the end without finding an empty cell.
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>2.2 Trying Numbers (1 - 9)</li>
    In the first empty cell, we try which number is valid.

    <ul>
        <li>2.2.1 Row
        Check if the number is valid in it is row, except the cell within.</li>
        <li>2.2.2 Column
        Check if the number is valid in it is column, except the cell within.</li>
        <li>2.2.3 Square
        Check if the number is valid in it is Square, except the cell within.2.3 Recursion
        Calling the function again, and checking the return to make the recursion
        condition.</li>
    </ul>




</ul>
